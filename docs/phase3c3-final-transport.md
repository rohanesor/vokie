# Phase 3C.3 final transport pass

## Status: PARTIAL

Raw Bluetooth and Wi-Fi packet adapters now feed `TransportManager`; the application inbound stream uses `InboundPacketCoordinator`; Room has a replay table. Outbound selection is centralized through `TransportManager.sendMessage`.

The completion gate is not met: there is still one compatibility `Transport.send(Message)` call inside the manager, no manager-owned ACK registry for both transports, and no persistent retry/TTL worker. No claim of production-complete reliability is made.

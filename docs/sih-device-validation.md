# SIH physical-device validation

This report records only observed results. Do not mark an item passed without the stated test on a physical device.

## Candidate

- Build: `cc12704` or later
- APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- Device: realme narzo 60x 5G (Android SDK 35)
- Offline model payload: 1,172,553,259 bytes

## Capture commands

```bash
ADB=/tmp/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb scripts/collect-device-metrics.sh idle
# Start STT, then while it is processing:
ADB=/tmp/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb scripts/collect-device-metrics.sh stt-processing
# Start TTS playback:
ADB=/tmp/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb scripts/collect-device-metrics.sh tts-playing
```

Vokie writes measured STT processing time and RTF to the `VOKIE][STT` log tag. Capture one snapshot after each utterance.
